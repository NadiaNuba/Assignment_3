	<h1 style="background-color: pink "> Welcome to City of Magic:Dhaka</h1>
	<p> Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Set next to the Buriganga River, it's at the focal point of national government, exchange and culture. The seventeenth extremely old city was the Mughal capital of Bengal, and numerous royal residences and mosques remain. American draftsman Louis Khan's National Parliament House complex exemplifies the immense, quickly developing present day city. So I hope you will have fun with tour. </p>
